
Accept number and apply logic on that 

1) Sunny Number  ----  number ,   number +1 -  sqrt 

	number  = 80
	temp = number + 1   // 81
	 check temp is perfect sqaure or not 
	if it is perfect square then given number is sunny number  

2) Tech Number 
 A number is called a tech number if the given number has an even number of digits and 
the number can be divided exactly into two parts from the middle. After equally dividing 
the number, sum up the numbers and find the square of the sum.
 If we get the number itself as square, the given number is a tech 
number, else, not a tech number. For example, 2025 is a tech number.

	   2025
	20     25
	20+25 = 45   . sqaure of 45 is 2025 then it is Tech Number 

3) Neon Number  - number is equals with square digits sum then it is Neon Number
	number  - square  -  sum of digits 

	9     81 8+1
